# RAG Course Chatbot

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application
that answers questions over university course materials (PDF and text files).

The system retrieves relevant document chunks and generates answers **strictly
from the retrieved context**, returning *"I don't know"* when the information
is not present.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The application follows a vanilla RAG pipeline:

1. Document loading (PDF, TXT)
2. Text chunking with overlap
3. Semantic embedding using Sentence-Transformers
4. Vector storage with Chroma
5. Context-based answer generation using an open-source LLM
